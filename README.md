# Streamlit app for bridge scour risk prediction 
This application aims to provide a friendly environment for bridge enginners to evluate the scour risk in an accurate yet rapid way. 
Data used in this study was provided by the French National Rialway Company (SNCF). 
Detailed information of this study may refer to the following papers, which are currently under review and in preparation :
